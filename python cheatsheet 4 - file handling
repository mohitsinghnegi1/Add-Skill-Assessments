In Python you need to give access to a file by opening it. You can do it by using
the open() function. Open returns a file object, which has methods and attributes
for getting information about and manipulating the opened file.


----
With statement
With the "With" statement, you get better syntax and exceptions handling. 

"The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common
preparation and cleanup tasks."

In addition, it will automatically close the file. The with statement provides
a way for ensuring that a clean-up is always used.
-----
Without the with statement, we would write something like this:
//file is file discriptor
file = open("welcome.txt",[r,w,a,r+])
//file.name //these are the property
//file.mode //
//file.tell() //will tell the current position of the pointer
//file.seek(index) //change location to any pos
//file.read()
//file.write()

data = file.read([number of char to read])
read return "" when EOF

to get as a list 
line = lines=file.readline()
print(line,end="")
lines=file.readlines()

print data
for line in data:
	line.strip() //this will remove \n and space from each line
file.close()  # It's important to close the file when you're done with it
------

With Statement Usage
Opening a file using with is as simple as: with open(filename) as file:
//using a context maanger
with open("welcome.txt") as file: # Use file to refer to the file object

   data = file.read()

   do something with data
Opens output.txt in write mode
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:  # Use file to refer to the file object

   file.write('Hi there!')
	
Notice, that we didn't have to write "file.close()". That will automatically be
called.

opening two files simultaniously using coma separate or nesting
//this is for text file
with open('test1.text','r') as rf:
	with open('text_copy.txt','w') as wf:
	
		for line in rf:
		
			wf.write(line)
			
//for img or other file
with open('test1.text','rb') as rf:
	with open('text_copy.txt','wb') as wf:
	
		for line in rf:
		
			wf.write(line)
			
//this is for text file
with open('test1.text','r') as rf:
	with open('text_copy.txt','w') as wf:
	
		chunk_size=1024
		rf_chunk=rf.read(chunk_siz)
		while(len(rf_chunk)>0):
			wf.write(rf_chunk)
			rf_chunk=rf.read(chunk_siz)
